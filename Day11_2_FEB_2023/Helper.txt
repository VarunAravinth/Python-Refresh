Why?
logically group data and functions together.
code becomes maintainable and reusuable 
helps to write DRY code( Dont repeat yourself)

which is faster tuple or list ? 



Employee

1. name,salary,age,designation,gender
class variable -> salary

2. class method to increase the class variable ( salary) argument(10 percent)

inheritance -> employee

3. developer -> inherites -> employee ( salary increase 20 percent)
manager -> inherites from employee ( salary increase by 5 percent)


4. + add two employees -> salary average
